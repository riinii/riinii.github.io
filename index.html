            <h1>[React][JS] React's new Context API versus Redux</h1>
            <p>
              React's new Context API allows for easy data access across
              multiple components, just like Redux does. Initially, I wondered
              when should Context or Redux be used in regards to data access?
            </p>
            <p>
              According to reactjs.org: "Context provides a way to pass data
              through the component tree without having to pass props down
              manually at every level."
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.gistia.com/beginners-guide-redux/">
                Redux on the other hand is "a predictable state container for
                JavaScript apps."</a
              >
              <br />
              At first glance, one may wonder whether one should one use Context
              to pass data easily from point A to point B, or whether one should
              use Redux, which also allows for easy data access.
            </p>
            <p>
              It seems like it will generally be better to use React's Context
              API first if one only needed to pass data through multiple level
              of components. Redux seems to have a whole host of powerful
              utilities. I'll stay away from it for now, at least until I need
              something more powerful and more than just data accessing.

            <h1>[JS] Shallow vs Deep Copy of Objects</h1>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came across a bug the other day at work that
              was all attributed to shallow vs deep copy functionalities of
              objects.
            </p>
            <h4>What are shallow copies vs. deep copies?</h4>
            <p>
              When we do a shallow copy an object, only the references of the
              fields of the objects are copied to reference the other objects.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we do a deep copy, the references to the object is not
              copied. Instead, the values referenced are copied. Thus, changing
              values of one object will not affect the values of the other
              copied object.
            </p>
            <p>
              <!-- <h4>Here's an example to clear up any confusion:</h4> -->
              <!-- <br> -->
              We have two objects, object A and object B.
              <!-- <br> -->
              When object B makes a shallow copy of object A, any changes to
              Object A will also be reflected in Object B.
              <!-- <br>  -->
              On the other hand, if we make object B a deep copy of object A,
              any changes to object A will not affect Object B.
            </p>
            <p>
              I came across this issue when using React Highcharts. Our Pie
              chart from React Highcharts required a chart configuration, which
              was made up of an object.
            </p>
            <p>
              We used and re-used this component to create many pie-charts.
              There was a value we can set in the chart configuration object
              that allowed for semi-donut charts and full-donut charts.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, when one chart configuration for the semi-donut values
              were set, the previously set chart configurations for the
              full-donut chart were also changed to a semi-donut configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was because we were only using a shallow copy of the React
              Highchart's chart configuration. A shallow copy of an object has
              the copied object referencing the same values of the original
              object. Changing one value of the object (through either the
              original or copied object) will affect the other object.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is exactly what happened with the bug I encountered at work.
              The shallow copied chart config object was changed the second time
              I used the Pie component. That was why changing the chart
              configuration of the Pie chart to semi-donut values also changed
              the previous Pie chart--they were both referencing the same
              object!
            </p>
            <h4>How to avoid this?</h4>
            <p>
              <br />Be careful about using Object.assign() to copy objects, as
              Object.assign() makes a shallow copy. For redux, it is okay since
              Redux only contains immutable data.
            </p>
            <h4>Nested Objects?</h4>
            <p>
              If we don't know how deeply nested our objects are, you can call
              JSON.stringify and then parse the object to resolve this issue.
            </p>

            <p>
              A neat little tid bit to be careful of when coding. Shallow copies
              add deep copies deep copies are not language specific. This can
              happen in C or Java, not just JS!
            </p>

            <h1>[Personal] My 2019 Goals</h1>
            <p>
              In the past few months, I have came to the realization that I
              don't dream nearly enough. Consequently, my life became filled
              with ambivalence, passivity, and mediocrity. Luckily, I was able
              to realize what was happening to my life and create actionable
              steps to resolve this.
